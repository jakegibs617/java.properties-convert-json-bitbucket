# java.properties-convert-json-bitbucket

Create a key in a seperate file ie `config.py`
the key should be formatted like `READVSOP = 'Bearer W8W7W*****************kjh32kh2'`


This script starts with a commented out curl request to fetch a java.properties file from a private repo. 

The script continues with this purpose and saves that java.properties info locally and then converts it into JSON for the purpose of dynamically using the information in another application.
